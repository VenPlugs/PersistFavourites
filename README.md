# Persist Favourites

This plugin solves the problem of Discord randomly deciding to clear your gifs or emotes
by backing both up regularely and restoring them in case they get lost

Favourite gifs are shared across different accounts and will be merged on conflict

Emotes are saved on a per account basis as obviously other accounts will not have access to the same emotes
