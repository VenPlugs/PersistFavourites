# Persist Settings (formerly PersistFavourites)

This plugin solves the problem of Discord randomly deciding to clear your settings
by backing them up regularly and restoring them when needed.

You may also use this to transfer them between devices, you simply need to copy powercord/settings/PersistSettings.json to wherever you want it.
